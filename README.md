# GoKritz land github

These are cherry-picked files from my tf folder on the VPS that I use to host GoKritz land, a TF2 community server with competitive/skill-based gameplay and map optimizations in mind.

### IF YOU WANNA COPY THIS
DON'T clone the repo, find a guide somewhere else for setting up a TF2 server. Get it to hello world, and then copy over these files into your tf folder/directory.

rename server_copy.cfg to server.cfg, and MODIFY it in notepad or a text editor or something to change stuff like your RCON password, server name, etc etc

CHECK .gitignore FOR MAPS THAT I HAVE EXCLUDED - SOME OF THEM WERE TOO BIG
